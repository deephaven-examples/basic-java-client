# Basic Java Client Example

This repository consists of a basic example of connecting a Deephaven Java client to a Deephaven server session. Please
see the [Getting Started](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/tutorials/quickstart/) section of our website for information
on how to start a Deephaven server session.

This example uses Deephaven's [Barrage](https://github.com/deephaven/barrage) protocol, which is an extension
of [Apache Arrow Flight](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Flight.html).
